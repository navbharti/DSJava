        "A **Red-Black** tree is a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** with one extra attribute for each node: the **colour**, which is either **red or black**. We also need to keep track of the **parent** of each node.\n",
        "\n",
        "A red-black tree is a binary search tree which has the following red-black properties:\n",
        "1. Every node is either red or black.\n",
        "2. Every leaf (NULL) is black.\n",
        "3. If a node is red, then both its children are black.\n",
        "4. Every simple path from a node to a descendant leaf contains the same number of black nodes.\n",
