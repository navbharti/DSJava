    "2. **Doubly Linked List** : In this type of Linked list, there are two references associated with each node, One of the reference points to the next node and one to the previous node. Advantage of this data structure is that we can traverse in both the directions and for deletion we don’t need to have explicit access to previous node. Eg. NULL<-1<->2<->3->NULL\n",
    "3. **Circular Linked List** : Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list. Advantage of this data structure is that any node can be made as starting node. This is useful in implementation of circular queue in linked list. Eg. 1->2->3->1 [The next pointer of last node is pointing to the first]\n",
